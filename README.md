# Genetic Algorithms

* **Parameter-Tuning**. A tuning algorithm optimizes the running parameters of other applications. Used in 

* **Clique_GA**. The clique genetic algorithm computes the CLIQUE problem on given graphs.
 
* **bin** On this directory there are compiled instances of the algorithms.
* **GA_modeling**. Work on progress.
