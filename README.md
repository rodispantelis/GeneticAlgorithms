# Genetic Algorithms

* **Parameter-Tuning**. A tuning algorithm optimizes the running parameters of other applications. Used in [1].

* **Clique_GA**. The clique genetic algorithm computes the CLIQUE problem on given graphs.
 
* **bin**. In this directory there are compiled instances of the algorithms.

* **GA_modeling**. Work in progress.
